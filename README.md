# Landing page repo for Giesela Inc.

> `https://giesela.ch`, `https://giesela.io`, `https://giesela.bot`, `https://giesela.org`, and `https://giesela.app` are EV SSL validated by DigiCert and will serve various purposes as we get closer to the time for such. (e.g. as [the incomplete Giesela Statuspage](https://status.giesela.app)) or [this one](https://giesela.statusy.co) (I know - don't ask ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
